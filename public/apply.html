				All positions require dedicated people who have a passion for system programming.<br/>
				Everyone is welcome to apply!<br/>
				Those who submit a promising application will be offered an interview.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Please Keep in mind that the following will probably be working closely together:
				<ul class="list-group">
					<li class = "list-group-item">
						Lab Assistants and Office Hours Assistants
					</li>
					<li class = "list-group-item">
						Machine Problem Development and Autograding
					</li>
				</ul>
				So you could easily commit to two teams without too much additional work.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Also note that all role descriptions look more intimidating than they are because of my poor writing and bad CSS. <br/>
				This course is a lot more fun than it is work :)

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<div class="panel panel-default">
			 	<div class="panel-body">
			 		UIUC CS has wide variety of talent ranging from those who know more than all the instructors combined to those who are still learning to use the terminal.
					And at some point almost all of these students come to office hours to get extra help.
					Whether it be drawing figures on the whiteboard or stepping through GDB, the labor of a Office Hour Assistant is priceless.
					In fact, few things are more rewarding than helping a student understand and to help them develop a passion for the subject you teach.

					<p class="list-group-item-text">
						A lot of the times students might ask you questions that you feel are "dumb" or "trivial", but the reality is that we were all there at one point and it is important to constantly empathize and think back to when you were a CS 241 Student.
						Most of the times, you can fill the gap in a student's understanding of the material just by remembering why you struggled with the material and what helped you understand it.
						However, some students might not get the material even after the third time you explained it to them.
						This is where patience comes into play, since you probably just have to think of another way of explaining the material to them.

						Friendly Personailty and Demeanor

					<p class="list-group-item-text">
						Students will most likely come to office hours stressed and upset after debugging for several hours and waiting on a long queue.

						It helps to understand the material well and be comfortable with it, but if you can not explain the material, then you are essentially useless in office hours.
						You also have to be adaptable in the ways you explain things, since the how you understand the problem might not be how your students best understand a problem.

				</div>
				<div class = "list-group-item">
					<h4 class="list-group-item-heading">
						Debugging
					</h4>
					<p class="list-group-item-text">
						It should go without saying that debugging is a critical skill to have when running an office hour.
						Most of the bugs that can be found during office hours can be easily found by using GDB, Valgrind and print statements.
						Another important part of debugging is the ability to consider edge cases that your students might not have thought about.
						And most importantly, you should be able to step through your students logic and help narrow the search for the line of code that is causing everything to go wrong downstream.

					<h4 class="list-group-item-heading">
						Firm Knoweldge of the Assignments Given In the Course
					</h4>
					<p class="list-group-item-text">
						Students will mainly come into office hours needing help interpreting the MP Docs or debugging code.
						It is most time efficent if you get familiar with the assignments before you walk into office hours.
						This way you are quickly able to interpret MP documentation for your students.
						You should also think of common bugs most your students are going to have and which parts of the assignment they are going to struggle the most on.

						This is probably be what the bulk of the team meeting will be spent on.
						You will probably meet with someone on the MP Development team who will go over the specs of the MP.
						And in this time the team should at least go over the detailed TA-Solution the MP Team will put together.
						This time is also useful for going over common bugs that you will encounter.

						It should go without being said that as an office hour assistant you will be hosting office hours.
						This is the time where you will put yourselves on the chara queue and help students on the queue.
						The reason we want about 3 hours a week is becuase you get better at finding an MPs bugs overtime, so it would be kind of a waste if you only did one hour.

			 		Machine Problems are the meat and cheese of any programming course.
					These assignments are supposed to be rigourous enough so that students can fully apply their knowledge of systems.
					And interesting enough, so that they have a memorable experience of the course.
					Writing Machine Problems involves coming up with a meaningful assignments where students can not only apply their knowledge, but also learn.
					Writing these assignments involves a lot of time drafting on whiteboards and bouncing ideas.
					As you are writing these assignments you will have to ask yourself "What am I trying to have the students learn?".
					Students are very busy and you can not give MPs that take 35 hrs and have them spend a bunch of time doing string manipulation (unless that is the intent of the assignment).
					Finally, with any good MP comes an excellent documentation that is clear, concise, contextual and correct.

			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			 	<div class="panel-body">
			 		There are many assignments in a programming class and CS 241 is no exception.
					All these assignments need to be graded and as the field of computing grow so does its students.
					It is no longer feasable to grade all these assignments by hand or have every student present their code to a T.A.
					This is where autograding comes into play.
					Autograding is essentially writing scripts that can take a student's code and run a series of testcases to best measure its correctness and perfermance.
					At a high level the process of autograding is as follows:
					<ul class="list-group">
						<li class = "list-group-item">Write testcases and scripts</li>
						<li class = "list-group-item">Have script grade students acording to timetable</li>

					It has become a plethora or brilliant young minds that want to learn skills that will help in their pursuit to becoming the strongest version of themselves.
					With this comes to opportunity of making educational resources available to students.
					Last semesters we had a couple of projects which included ClassTranscribe and Markdown2PDF.
					ClassTranscribe took static lecture videos and transcribed them, so that students can easily find the content they desire.
					Markdown2PDF took the already popular CS241 WikiBook and automated the process of converting it to a PDF, so that students can have a physical copy of the most up to date wikibook.
					Little things like these make the learning experience at UIUC memorable and unique.

			 		The honors sections for CS 241 is a lot like anything else in 241; fun, challenging and rewarding.
			 		This section will be filled with the university's most talented and most enthusiastic.
			 		This translates to honor's students being the most knoweledge hungry and our pickiest customers.
			 		They will except a section that pushes the bounds of a system programming course and you will be responsible for providing exactly that.
			 		Unlike the rest of the course, material and content will be geared toward the A and A+ students.
			 		You will interact with students that match and may supercede your intelligence and the thought of this should excite you.
			 		If you have a deep passion for systems and want to instill that passion in the course's 1%, then this is the position for you.

			 		If you do not want to develop content and do lab sections or office hours, but want to answer 2000+ piazza questions, then by you should by all means apply for course staff.
			 		Others "free role" things could be administrating VMs or doing web development here and there.
