          In this course we are using the VMs for all our development so it is important that you learn how to use them. <br/><br/>
          Please ssh or FastX into your VM. I have provided the ip in your svn repo.<br/>
          If you want to ssh and your netid is 'bschong2' and your ip is 'fa15-cs241-000.cs.illinois.edu', then all you need to do is enter <pre class = "terminal">ssh bschong2@fa15-cs241-000.cs.illinois.edu</pre> into your terminal.
          If you want a GUI, then you should use FastX and follow these <a href = "https://it.engineering.illinois.edu/user-guides/remote-access/connecting-ews-linux-fastx">instructions</a>.

          In this course we are using SVN to submit all our assignments<br/><br/>
          <strong>Once you are in your VM</strong> please checkout your svn repo with the following command
          <pre class = "terminal">svn co https://subversion.ews.illinois.edu/svn/fa15-cs241/YOUR-NETID cs241</pre>
          which will check out your entire SVN repo into a folder called 'cs241' into your current directory.
          Now change your directory into the 'cs241' folder <pre class = "terminal">cd cs241</pre> and create a 'Lab1' folder <pre class = "terminal">mkdir Lab1</pre>
          Now check the status of your repo <pre class = "terminal">svn status</pre> and notice that you now have a 'Lab1' folder that needs to be added.
          Add the 'Lab1' folder to svn <pre class = "terminal">svn add Lab1</pre> and commit it <pre class = "terminal">svn ci -m "adding the Lab1 folder"</pre>

          Now check out your first git repo for this class (outside of your SVN directory)!

          <strong>Once you are in your VM</strong> please create a file called 'dumb.c' in your Lab1 directory that you just made.
          Now write a valid C program in 'dumb.c' that will segfault.
          Now compile with clang <pre class = "terminal">clang dumb.c -o dumb -g</pre>
          Run it to make sure it segfaults <pre class = "terminal">./dumb</pre>
          Run valgrind to see what line it segfaults on <pre class = "terminal"> valgrind ./dumb</pre>
          Run gdb to see what line it segfaults on <pre class = "terminal">gdb ./dumb </pre> <pre class = "terminal">run</pre> <pre class = "terminal">backtrace</pre>
          Then exit gdb <pre class = "terminal">quit</pre>
          Now commit 'dumb.c' to your Lab1 folder on svn (I leave this as an excerise to the reader).

          Now onto the main part of the lab<br/><br/>
          Please form a group of 4 to 6 and show everyone your bad C programs and explain the errors made in your code.
          After that, as a group create a new sneaky but short C example and see if you can hide a deliberate mistake in it.
          Challenge the rest of the lab to see if they can spot the error.
          20 lines of code maximum (excluding blank lines) - the errors not obvious but still 'in plain sight'
