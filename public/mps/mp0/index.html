    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <div class="containter">
    <p>
      In CS 125, CS 225, and other classes, you have used various languages that are considered to be &quot;C based&quot;, but up to now you may have very limited experience in C programming.  This MP will provide a short programming
      introduction to pointers, strings, and functions in C.
    </p>

    <p>
      This machine problem will be divided up into two pieces. In
      the first piece, you will be modifying functions originally
      with errors such that the outputs match the given output. In
      the second piece, you will need to write some code to call
      some 'creatively defined' functions so that those functions
      produce the desired output.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this MP, you may modify:
      <ul>
        <li><tt>part1-functions.c</tt></li>
        <li><tt>part2-main.c</tt></li>
      </ul>

      All other files will be replaced with new/different files for grading.  If you modify any other files for debugging purposes, please ensure you test your program with the original file.

    <h4 id="task1">Part 1:</h4>
    <div class="container">

    <p>
      There are erroneous/unimplemented functions
      in <tt>part1-functions.c</tt>. Your task is to modify
      functions according to comment above each function such that the
      output of part1 looks exactly as follows:

    <h4>Part 2:</h4>
    <div class="container">

    <p>
      We have pre-uploaded some files to your pointers_gone_wild svn directory, including <tt>part2-functions.c</tt>.  Inside <tt>part2-functions.c</tt>, you will see twelve different functions, including <tt>first_step()</tt> (re-printed below).
    </p>
    <blockquote id="code_segment">
      void first_step(int value)<br />
      {<br />
      &nbsp; if (value == 81)<br />
      &nbsp; &nbsp; printf("1: Illinois\n");<br />
      }
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      To complete Part 2, you must complete the program <tt>part2-main.c</tt> so that <tt>part2-main.c</tt> makes calls to all twelve functions in <tt>part2-functions.c</tt> such that they print their &quot;Illinois&quot; line. The struct data_t, the val_t Union and type_t enum are in the part2-functions.h header file. <br> When running
      <tt>./part2</tt>, your output should look exactly like:
    </p>

    <blockquote id="code_segment">
      1: Illinois<br />
      2: Illinois<br />
      3: Illinois<br />
      4: Illinois<br />
      5: Illinois<br />
      6: Illinois<br />
      7: Illinois<br />
      8: Illinois<br />
      9: Illinois<br />
      10: Illinois<br />
      11: Illinois<br/>
      12: Illinois
    </blockquote>
    <b> Note: </b> <br/> The tricky_step problem in part2 attempts to allow for computations with the "+" and the "-" operators with different data types (Strings, Integers and Floats) <br/>
  <u> <br/> It expects some implicit conversion between types such as: </u> <br/> <br/> <b>1) FLOAT +/- INT = FLOAT </b> ( 10.0 - 2 = 8.0 ) <br/> <b> 2) STRING + INT/FLOAT = STRING </b> ( "CS" + 241 = "CS241"  - Appending a integer/float to a string )
  <br/> <b> 3) STRING - INT/FLOAT = ERROR </b> ( "CS241" - 241, ERROR is one of the enumerated types in part2-functions.h ) <br/>

  <br/> <u> You may also make the following assumptions: </u>
  <br/>
  <br/> <b> 1) Any float or integer in the problem will not be longer than 4 digits. </b>
  <br/> <b> 2) When a float is appended to a string, it is truncated to 2 decimal places. </b>
 <br/> <b>  3) All string values in data_t that is returned by func must be malloc-ed in func as it will be attempted to be freed by tricky_step </b> 

  <br/>

  <br/> Before attempting the tricky_step problem, you will need to have a solid understanding of function pointers, structs and unions.

        You should NOT edit the part2-functions.c file. In fact, when we grade your
        program, we will replace the part2-functions.c file with a new version of
        the file (and we'll change the &quot;Illinois&quot; string so printing out
        &quot;Illinois&quot; in a for-loop will get you no credit).

      <blockquote id="code_segment">
        make clean<br />
        make
      </blockquote>

      To run Part 1:
      <blockquote id="code_segment">
        ./part1

    <h2>Grading, Submission, and Other Details</h2>
    <div class="container">
       <p>
      Please fully read details on  <a href="https://wiki.cites.illinois.edu/wiki/display/undergradProg/Honor+Code">Grading and Academic Honesty</a>. These are shared between  all MPs in CS 241.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will be using Subversion as our hand-in system this semester. Our grading system will checkout your most recent (pre-deadline) commit for grading. Therefore, to hand in your code, all you have to do is commit it to your Subversion repository.</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To check out the provided code for pointers_gone_wild from the class repository, go to the directory you want your work to be downloaded to and type the following into the command console:
      <blockquote>
        svn co https://subversion.ews.illinois.edu/svn/fa15-cs241/NETID/pointers_gone_wild 
      </blockquote>
      where NETID is your University NetID. This will make a directory called pointers_gone_wild which has all pointers_gone_wild code in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To commit your changes to the repository type:
      <blockquote>
      svn ci -m "pointers_gone_wild submission"
      </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
      Your repository directory can be viewed from a web browser from the following URL:
      <blockquote>
        https://subversion.ews.illinois.edu/svn/fa15-cs241/NETID/pointers_gone_wild
      </blockquote>
      where NETID is your University NetID.
      It is important to check that the files you expect to be graded are present and up to date in your svn copy.
