            <h1>MP3: Malloc</h1>



			<h2>MP Introduction</h2>

   <p>In this MP, you will <strong>re-implement</strong> the function heap-memory function calls <code class="code-block">malloc()</code>, <code class="code-block">calloc()</code>, <code class="code-block">realloc()</code>, and <code class="code-block">free()</code> in much the same way that valgrind re-implements
    many C-calls to understand how your program is using memory.  Just like valgrind, you will be able to use almost any existing program with your new memory functions:
    this includes utility programs such as &quot;ls&quot; text editors like &quot;vi&quot;, or any other programs that runs on Linux.
    </p>

      <h2>MP Requirements</h2>


			<p>Your MP is broken up into two deliverables project:</p>

			<ol>
                <li><strong>Part 1</strong> invovles implementing a <strong>basic</strong> correct solution of the heap-memory function call <code class="code-block">malloc()</code>. It must pass all the tests in the <strong>Part 1</strong> directory.These are relatively straightforward tests
   designed to get you up and running quickly.  They will mostly work with a naive implementation that does a poor job of freeing memory.  Remember that later you will need to iterate on your solution so that it can pass
   more complex tests.</li>
                <br>
                <li>In <strong>Part 2</strong>, you will be working on improving your allocator's speed and efficiency of memory use in order to get the remaining tests running and improving your performance relative to the system implementation of <code class="code-block">malloc()</code>.  In this portion of the MP you will need a more sophisticated
 version of <code class="code-block">realloc()</code> and <code class="code-block">free()</code> capable of avoiding fragmentation in large allocations. And for fun, you'll be able to submit your malloc to a class contest. </p></li>
			</ol>
      <p>We provide two types of files:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>mreplace.c / mcontest.c / alloc-contest.c / debug.h</b>: <span style="color: #880000;">Don't edit these file!</span><br />
            These files create the system environment to ensure that calls to <tt>malloc()</tt> and related memory functions are passed on to <b>your</b> memory functions and not the standard libc ones. You should not edit this file, as we will replace it with a new, clean copy when we run your program.<br />
            <br />
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>alloc.c</b>: <span style="color: #008800;">Edit this file!</span><br />
            This file provides blank implementations of <tt>malloc()</tt>, <tt>realloc()</tt>, and <tt>free()</tt>.  Since <tt>calloc()</tt> is a trivial modification of <tt>malloc()</tt>, we provide a working version of <tt>calloc()</tt> that makes use of your <tt>malloc()</tt>.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <span style="color: #880000">For the purpose of this MP, you are not allowed to use any other form of storage.  You may <b>not</b> use files, pipes, system shared
    memory, mmap, a chunk of pre-defined static memory, a chunk of pre-defined stack memory, other external memory libraries
    found on the Internet, or any of the various other external sources of memory that
    exist on a modern operating system. Your re-implementation of malloc() must allocate heap memory using the sbrk() call. Note that all global variables should be declared static.</span><br />

    <br />
   
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <h4>A bad malloc</h4>

    <p>Memory allocation might seem a bit magical.  But you might be surprised to find out how easy it is to write a memory allocator which actually works in some primitive way. Let's do it now.  First, 
    <code class="code-block">malloc()</code>:</p>
        <pre class="big-code-block">
        <code class="code-block" style="white-space: pre !important;">void *malloc(size_t size)
{
    &nbsp; return sbrk(size);
}
        </code>
      </pre>
    <p>How does that work?  Malloc gets a request for <strong>size</strong> bytes of memory.  It then calls <code class="code-block">srbk(size)</code>.  This is a system call that asks the operating system to increase the heap by <strong>size</strong> bytes.  <code class="code-block">srbk()</code> returns a pointer to this new memory, and away we go.  Now, how about free?</p>
   
    <code class="code-block">free()</code>:</p>
        <pre class="big-code-block">
        <code class="code-block" style="white-space: pre !important;">void free(void *ptr)
{
}
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>That's right!  It's empty.  In a very limited way, this is a "correct" implementation.  You could write programs that use this <code class="code-block">malloc()</code> and <code class="code-block">free()</code>.  So what's wrong with this implementation?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We didn't check for errors when we called <code class="code-block">srbk()</code>.  OK, that seems straightforward to deal with.
        <li>We haven't implemented <code class="code-block">calloc()</code> or <code class="code-block">realloc()</code>.  But let's not worry about that now.
        <li>The big problem, as you have surely noticed, is that freed memory is never reused!  The heap will get bigger and bigger every time we call <code class="code-block">malloc()</code>, even if we always <code class="code-block">free()</code> the memory.  Pretty soon, we'll run out of memory in the computer.
      </ul>

    <p>To sum up, it's actually quite easy to request new memory from the operating system. Your memory allocator's other task is harder:  do the necessary <strong>bookkeeping</strong> to track what chunks of memory are allocated, and where the free holes are.</p>
			
    <h4>Testing your solution</h4>

    <p>In order to test your solution against the testers, run <code class="code-block">./mcontest</code> with the tester you want.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre class="big-code-block">
      <p><code class="code-block" style="white-space: pre !important;">./mcontest part1/tester-1
Memory failed to allocate!
[mcontest]: STATUS: FAILED=(256)
[mcontest]: MAX: 0
[mcontest]: AVG: 0.000000
[mcontest]: TIME: 0.000000</code></p></pre>

    <p>Or you can just run the bash script <code class="code-block">run_all_mcontest.sh</code> to run all testers</p>

    <p>Here are some of the possible error codes you'll get and what they mean:</p>
    <pre class="big-code-block">
      <p><code class="code-block" style="white-space: pre !important;">11: Seg Fault
15: Executed Too Long
139: Seg Fault
256, 512, 768, 1024: various errors in tester-# files
16640: Dynamic linking error
17408: Exceeded Memory Limit (2684354560)
</code></p></pre>

      <h2>Grading</h2>

        <a href="https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs241/#/overview#integrity">These are the Academic Integrity rules, shared between all MPs in CS 241. Please read them; they're for your own benefit.</a>

            <p>Here's the grading breakdown:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li><strong>25%</strong>: Part 1</li>
            	<li><strong>25%</strong>: Part 2, Tests 1-6</li>
            	<li><strong>25%</strong>: Part 2, Tests 7-11</li>
            	<li><strong>25%</strong>: Performance within 200% of libc</li>
            </ul>

			<h2>Feedback</h2>

            <p>We want to keep an open feedback loop, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14Jmo_0DLVgcp6MYyuCYBjcKch6uX2-uXyoGxtqLVdXA/viewform?usp=send_form">this is our way of listening to and incorporating your feedback.</a></p>

            <p><strong>Please include what we do well and what we can improve on (pluses and deltas).</strong> Deltas aren't negatives--they just tell us where we can focus our attention next to give you the best experience as a student.</p>

			<p>We hope you learn a lot with this MP!</p>
