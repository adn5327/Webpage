      <p>First, let's start off with some warnings. These are important, so please read them. That's why they're at the top of the page and in red.</p>

      <h2>Warnings</h2>
      <ol class="warning">
        <li>If your code fork bombs on any autograde, then you will automatically fail this MP</li>
        <li>Please make doubly sure that your fork() code is correct before committing your code for the nightly autograder.</li>
        <li>Please print the PID of the process executing the command i.e. the PID of the child process.</li>
      </ol>



			<h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          You're an intern at Grapple, and their Dev Ops group is moving all developers from their minimalist GUI to a shell. Congratulations! You've been selected as the recipient of the honor of implementation, because nobody else wanted to do it.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this MP, you will implement a simple Unix shell (e.g., bash, csh etc.) called 'wtsh'. The basic function of a shell is to accept commands as inputs and execute the corresponding programs in response.
        </p>

        <p>
          The purpose of this MP is to help you learn the basics of system calls for creating and managing processes as you implement your Shell program.
          You will write the code for your Shell program in shell.c.
          You will also be required to implement the functions in log.c, log.h, vector.c, and vector.h.
        </p>

        <p>
          Make Tom Chef, your CEO, proud.
        </p>

      <h2>Part 1: Log</h2>
        <p>
          Your mentor has helped you split up the tasks for this assignment, and has left her notes in the .h files.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to create the Shell, you'll implement the data structure Log. The Log struct contains a Vector (an automatically-expanding array of strings) to efficiently add, search, and retrieve commands executed by the shell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take a look at <strong>vector.h</strong> for implementation definitions. Know that you're responsible for testing the functionality of Vector before proceeding to the next part of the MP.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, open up <strong>log.h</strong> to know what to implement for the Log struct. As with Vector, you're responsible for testing Log's functionality for extreme edge cases before going on to the Shell part.
        </p>
        <p>
          To test your code, your mentor left you a <strong>vector_test.c</strong> and <strong>log_test.c</strong> that reflects how little she cares about testing (obviously you care a lot more).
        </p>
        <p>
          Good luck!
        </p>

      <h3>Details</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You are allowed to edit the files: <strong>log.h</strong>, <strong>log.c</strong>, <strong>vector.h</strong>, <strong>vector.c</strong></li>
          <li>You MUST implement the declared functions in the header files (or you will fail). This also means you can not modify the function signatures.</li>
          <li>You MAY add extra helper functions to your header files.</li>
          <li>You are also allowed to edit <strong>vector_test.c</strong> and <strong>log_test.c</strong>, but we will not grade them.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Part 2: Shell</h2>
        <p>Before your meeting with your mentor ended, you asked about the actual shell.</p>
        <p>"Don't worry," she said, checking her Grapple clock. "We'll talk about this when we get to it. Good luck, intern!"</p>

      <h2>Grading</h2>

        <a href="https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs241/#/overview#integrity">These are the Academic Integrity rules, shared between all MPs in CS 241. Please read them; they're for your own benefit.</a>

            <p>Here's the grading breakdown:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li><strong>25%</strong>: Part 1</li>
            	<li><strong>75%</strong>: Part 2</li>
            </ul>

			<h2>Feedback</h2>

            <p>We want to keep an open feedback loop, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14Jmo_0DLVgcp6MYyuCYBjcKch6uX2-uXyoGxtqLVdXA/viewform?usp=send_form">this is our way of listening to and incorporating your feedback.</a></p>

            <p><strong>Please include what we do well and what we can improve on (pluses and deltas).</strong> Deltas aren't negatives--they just tell us where we can focus our attention next to give you the best experience as a student.</p>

			<p>We hope you learn a lot with this MP!</p>
